# RBAC 403 Forbidden Issue - Solution

## Problem
You're getting 403 Forbidden errors when accessing `/api/admin/users` and `/api/admin/stats` despite having superadmin privileges.

## Root Cause
The JWT token in your browser was likely created before your user role was updated to 'superadmin'. The token still contains the old role information.

## Solution

### Step 1: Clear Current Session
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Find Local Storage for your domain
4. Delete the 'token' key
5. Refresh the page

### Step 2: Log Back In
1. Log in again with your superadmin credentials
2. This will generate a new JWT token with the correct 'superadmin' role

### Step 3: Verify Permissions
After logging back in, the admin endpoints should work correctly.

## Database Verification
Your database permissions are correctly set up:
- superadmin role has: manage_users, manage_training, view_admin_dashboard, system_administration
- Your user (mti.admin@merdekabattery.com) has the 'superadmin' role

## Debugging Added
I've added debugging logs to the RBAC middleware. You can now see detailed permission checking in the backend console when accessing admin endpoints.

## Alternative Quick Fix
If the above doesn't work, you can also:
1. Close all browser tabs
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart the browser
4. Log in again
